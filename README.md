## üéõÔ∏è Controls Reference

### Core Settings

| Control | Purpose | Default | Notes |
|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| **Recovery type** | Choose between automatic or manual recovery | Recovery Brush (0) | 0 = Recovery Brush, 1 = Motion Mask |
| **View Mode** | Toggle output between final result and diagnostic | RGB (1) | 0 = Difference View, 1 = RGB Output |

### Motion Analysis

| Control | Purpose | Default | Notes |
|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| **Aggressiveness** | Optical flow motion detection intensity | 2 | Higher = more detailed motion analysis |
| **motionThreshold** | Sensitivity for motion-based masking | 25.2 | Lower = more areas treated as motion |

### Dirt Detection

| Control | Purpose | Default | Notes |
|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| **temporalThreshold** | How aggressive the dirt detection is | 0.8 | Lower = more sensitive, detects smaller defects |
| **dirtSize** | Minimum size of defects to detect | 0.01 | Smaller = detects tinier dirt particles |
| **motionEstType** | Motion estimation algorithm | (varies) | Different methods for motion calculation |
| **supportLength** | Temporal window for analysis | (varies) | How many frames to analyze together |

### Advanced Options

| Control | Purpose | Default | Notes |
|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| **Recovery/Spanish Dirt Removal** | Toggle brush polarity behavior | Recovery (1) | 1 = Paint protects, 0 = Paint targets |
| **edgeAttenuation** | Reduce processing near edges | 0 | Helps avoid edge artifacts |
| **showRepairMask** | Display the repair mask | 0 | For diagnostic purposes |

### Input Connections

| Input | Purpose | Required |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Main Input** | Source footage to process | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Mask Paint/Magic Mask** | External mask for Recovery Brush | Only for paint features |

> **üí° Learning Tip**: Start with default settings and adjust **temporalThreshold** and **dirtSize** first. Use **View Mode** to switch to Difference view to see exactly what's being detected and changed.
